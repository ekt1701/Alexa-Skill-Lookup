# Alexa-Skill-Lookup

A very simple skill to hear the name of the Alexa skills released on a certain day. You can say today, yesterday, last Thursday, July 15, 2016 and so on.

The configuration is Runtime: Python 2.7, Handler: lambda_function.lambda_handler, Existing Role: lambda_basic_execution.  The code is entered in-line. The source of the data is https://github.com/dale3h/alexa-skills-list/raw/master/skills.csv

With the data, it is possible to get skills, based on ratings, number of reviews, get the description for the skill, name of author. Just need to code it :)
